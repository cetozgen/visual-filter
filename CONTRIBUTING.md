👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The project is still new, and I wrote it as an opportunity to learn new things. However, that doesn't mean it's not open for contributions. For now, please follow the following guidelines when contributing:

- Fork the project repo.
- Write your changes in a separate branch.
- Write your changes in small commits.
- Submit a PR.
- Tab yourself on the back. You've done a great job.

**Note**: If your PR encapsulates huge modifications, maybe it's best to submit an issue first proposing your changes.
